## Absract

Understanding equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS, equilibrium warming in response to a doubling of CO2) uncertainty is fundamental for making reliable climate projections. We leverage the Hector simple climate model in a probabilistic framework to explore how different ECS priors influence uncertainty in long-term (2081-2100) temperature projections. This method demonstrates a computationally efficient probabilistic workflow that explores the effects of parameter priors on climate projections. Excluding process and paleoclimate evidence in ECS priors widens resulting temperature projection uncertainty (a 5-95% confidence range of 1.12-3.03 ℃ and 1.09-3.33 ℃, respectively), while synthesizing all lines of evidence narrows temperature projection uncertainty (1.24-2.89 ℃; 5-95% CI), suggesting a  more robust range of future temperature outcomes.

## Key Points

- Uncertainty in equilibrium climate sensitivity distributions propagates through to future temperature projections.
- Prior distributions that exclude process and paleoclimate evidence result in the most uncertain future temperature projections.
- Using simple climate models with a probabilistic framework can help test the effects of different parameter priors on climate projections.

## 2. Reproducing the Analysis

To fully reproduce the analysis, execute each `.Rmd` file in the **`workflows/`** directory in sequential order, as indicated by their numerical prefixes.

Each `.Rmd` file includes detailed documentation that describes the analytical steps, methodological choices, and underlying assumptions. These embedded notes provide:  
- A structured overview of the objectives for each step in the workflow.  
- Justifications for analystical approaches.  
- Explanations of key statistical and computational methods used in the study.  
- References to relevant external sources where applicable.  

All processed datasets generated during the analysis will be stored in the **`workflows/data/`** directory.  
Publication figures and any preliminary visualizations produced from the workflow will be saved in the **`workflows/figures/`** directory.

For a comprehensive understanding of the methodology, users are encouraged to review the `.Rmd` files alongside their execution.
